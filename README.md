# User Assets plugin for Craft CMS

Users have there own isolated asset location within the defined sources.


## Installation

To install User Assets, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `userassets` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/samuelbirch/Craft-UserAssets.git` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `userassets` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

User Assets works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.

## User Assets Overview

This plugin will create a subfolder within each asset source named after the username. If the folder doesn't exist it will be created automatically.

The user will be able to create subfolders and manage their assets just as they would normally.

Admin's see everything!

Only tested with local sources currently.
